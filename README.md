### About Burmese Calendar


The Burmese calendar is a traditional calendar used in Myanmar, also known as Burma. 
It is based on an ancient astrological system and is known as the "Myanmar Era."

The Burmese calendar has a long and rich history, dating back over 2,000 years. 
It is closely tied to Buddhist tradition and is used to mark important religious festivals and events.

Today, the calendar is used in Myanmar(Burma) as one of the two official calendars alongside the Gregorian calendar. 
It is still used to mark traditional holidays such as the Burmese New Year, and other traditional festivals, many of which are Burmese Buddhist in nature.
